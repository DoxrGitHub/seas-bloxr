# The private Replit Schema, leaked

It was leaked like 2 hours back as of right now and I really do not want it taken down; therefore it's here :D I won't say who leaked it but well that info's public right now on a specific site.

It is somewhat outdated. 

For context, this was entirely private before even though anyone who figured out how Replit's GQL stuff or had a copy of the schema privately, so its kind of crazy that it was leaked. If you ended up using it, you would probably get banned if a mod found out, but the funny thing is that [anyone could use it anyways](https://replit.com/graphql). Nobody uses Replit anymore though, so I doubt the schema is gonna be abused by anyone who would have an interest in doing so for actually bad reasons anyways (ALL community features were deleted and the entire platform has been enshittified).
