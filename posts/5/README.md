# Question:
**say you were offered 10 million dollars, but for 1 year, you can only drink Coke Zero (specifically the canned variety)
would you take the money?**

# Response:
obviously

with 10 million dollars

I'd probably spend 1 million dollars on actual servers and like shit

maybe rig it up to a bunch of solar panels

9 million dollars

wait until another artifical pump in some stock like gamestop or a rise in a cryptocurrency coin like bitcoin

and then get the timing right

I'll probably grow it to like 900 million

from there start mass producing stuff and make an amazon type thing

start dominating the internet

add a letter to GAFAM

probably a D for doxr

GAFAM'D

I'd probably have a net worth of billions by that point

then monopolize electric car development

take over tesla

have multiple mega companies in different profitable industries and take over as much as possible

by now my companies would probably overshadow amazon

microsoft

probably google and apple

now at this point I'd have more money than to know what to do with

so I use that money to buy out other companies

gamepass but next level

everything would be doxr branded because I would've taken over EVERYTHING

now with all of this money I make deals with governments and get a piece of land to myself

like full ownership

anarchy

I become a dictator

and factories start mass producing over there

the entire place becomes a wasteland and there are ZERO regulations

so doxr enterprises becomes more profitable and efficient

elon musk would have nothing on me

the name doxr would be an household name

but most importantly I don't touch space exploration publicly

because after a while doxr factory land would become too toxic to work in

since it handles basically everything on the market now

[referring to space exploration] because what I actually do is try to hide that from the public and get a planet like mars to have automated manufactoring and I don't have to worry about waste

they get shipped to the earth while all the goofies still try to get to mars and everything

and then when the owner (me) of everything basically dies I leave it all to nothing

and cause HAVOC

the market would go down

everything would be underproduced

the one company they relied on

gone

W plan?

assuming we're far enough in the future

I could preserve as much as needed

or literally

modify my brain

to not mentally have that much stress

shit I think the neurolink stuff would help with that

This is probably wildly inaccurate and not what would happen in reality but fun to see unfold. I copied these messages from somewhere (thats why its not in "blog format") and it was silly. Also nowhere in there did I say I would drink Coke Zero at all :) I'll just stick with water
