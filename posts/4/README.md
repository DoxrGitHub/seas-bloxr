# Doxr's Evergrowing list of things to make

1. Shim-miner

> modifies a built sh1mmer usb to include xmrig and have the wifi payload run automatically, once connected xmrig will start mining on your shitty school chromebook to make approximately 0 cents

2. eagsetup

> NodeJS script to set up eaglercraft the way eaglercraft for replit did it but better

3. undetectabl

> proxy that does proxying things very weird & some UI changes that makes proxy detection nearly impossible, to AI, humans, and good content detection extensions

4. radium-movies

> movie client that uses yts.mx's api and webtor to make a good movie client that's legal since none of the content is hosted on the proxy
